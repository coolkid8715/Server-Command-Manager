# Server-Command-Manager
I made this for my server configuration.
No more room in hell server is can't set the config on server.cfg
so I made this, well this is very simple.

How to use this?
you just set on the config
"ServerCommand("");"
on this section.

ex: ServerCommand("sv_barricade_health 500;sv_realism 1");

and you just compile this and add the plugin :3
